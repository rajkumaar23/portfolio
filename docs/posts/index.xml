            <description>elementary OS has been my favourite Linux distro for quite a long time because of its beautiful UI, less bloatware which lets me focus on the work that needs to be done. After having used the OS, I wanted to contribute to it in some way or the other. And I started doing so by contributing to a currency converter app called Moneta which is available to download from elementary&amp;rsquo;s AppCenter.</description>

<p><a href="https://elementary.io">elementary</a> OS has been my favourite Linux distro for quite a long time because of its beautiful UI, less bloatware which lets me focus on the work that needs to be done. After having used the OS, I wanted to contribute to it in some way or the other. And I started doing so by contributing to a currency converter app called <a href="https://appcenter.elementary.io/com.github.matfantinel.moneta/">Moneta</a> which is available to download from elementary&rsquo;s AppCenter. <a href="https://github.com/matfantinel/moneta/commits?author=rajkumaar23">Here</a> is my commit to the same.</p>
<p>I had built a mini playstore <a href="https://github.com/rajkumaar23/playstore-api">API</a> using Slim PHP sometime back for generating badges for one of my android <a href="/posts/amrita-repository">app&rsquo;s</a> README file with real-time data from Google Playstore such as Version, Number of Installs, Rating etc. So, I had this crazy idea of building a tiny native GTK app from the scratch for the same. And after around 2 months, Badgie has passed the review and is live on elementary AppCenter <a href="https://appcenter.elementary.io/com.github.rajkumaar23.badgie">here</a>.</p>

            <title>Amrita Repository - Suite of Apps</title>
            <link>https://rajkumaar.co.in/posts/amrita-repository/</link>

            <description>In my first year of college, during the time of examinations more than 60% of my class used to pester those one or two guys who used to download the previous year question papers for reference from an intranet site (which still remains a mystery to most of the students). Being a hard-core techie, I wanted to bring an end to this and hence Amrita Repository was developed.
It started off as a Python CLI application providing access to only question papers which later extended itself to an android app and a telegram bot with much more helpful features.</description>

<p>In my first year of college, during the time of examinations more than 60% of my class used to pester those one or two guys who used to download the previous year question papers for reference from an intranet site (which still remains a mystery to most of the students). Being a hard-core techie, I wanted to bring an end to this and hence Amrita Repository was developed.</p>
<p>It started off as a Python CLI application providing access to only question papers which later extended itself to an android app and a telegram bot with much more helpful features. The suite of apps aim at helping students of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham to find all the materials pertaining to their curriculum of study under one portal with an easy to use interface. It has features including access to previous year question papers, student/faculty timetable, examination schedules, curriculum for various courses, attendance, grades, course resources uploaded by the faculty and latest news regarding the campus. The app has received 8000+ downloads in Play Store as on date, an appreciation letter from the Dean of Engineering, an average of ~4000 monthly active users and great responses from all the students as well as faculty.</p>

            <title>Farewell at Internshala</title>

            <description>Today was my last working day at Internshala and guess what! They sent me this picture as a farewell gesture! Looks amazing, isn&amp;rsquo;t it ? :D
Internshala is a technology company on a mission to equip students with relevant skills &amp;amp; practical exposure through internships and online trainings. Back in June 2018, when I was in my summer vacation after first year at college, all I knew was C and C++.</description>

<p>Today was my last working day at Internshala and guess what! They sent me this picture as a farewell gesture! Looks amazing, isn&rsquo;t it ? :D</p>
<p><a href="https://internshala.com">Internshala</a> is a technology company on a mission to equip students with relevant skills &amp; practical exposure through internships and online trainings. Back in June 2018, when I was in my summer vacation after first year at college, all I knew was C and C++. Hence, when I found this posting of C/C++ Teaching Assistant at <a href="https://trainings.internshala.com">Internshala Trainings</a> on their website, I wanted to give it a shot. Being offered an internship initially for 3 months, I&rsquo;m now bidding my farewell to Internshala after 2 years!</p>
<p>My main responsibility was to answer the student queries on the C/C++ Trainings forum, which taught me a lot of things especially patience. I also had difficult queries which I myself had never seen. The good thing about Internshala is that eventhough I was a remote intern, my suggestions/feedbacks were taken into consideration.</p>
<p>If it was not Internshala, I would not have been able to buy my first ever iPhone with the stipend I was given. It was a really good experience.</p>

            <title>CodeChef Interview Experience</title>
            <link>https://rajkumaar.co.in/posts/codechef-interview/</link>

            <description>I’m a regular user at LinkedIn and I came across the Software Development Engineer Internship’s poster by CodeChef when I was browsing through the feed one day. CodeChef’s interview process is very different unlike most other companies including its parent Directi. Due to COVID-19, my whole interview process was virtual.
Online Coding Round at CodeChef – 3 hours  1st and 2nd question were of beginner level (Reference) 3rd question (Easy) – You are given an array A1,A2,.</description>

<p>I’m a regular user at <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/rajkumaar23">LinkedIn</a> and I came across the <strong>Software Development Engineer
Internship</strong>’s poster by <a href="https://codechef.com">CodeChef</a> when I was browsing through the feed one day.
CodeChef’s interview process is very different unlike most other companies
including its parent <a href="Directi">Directi</a>. Due to COVID-19, my whole interview process was virtual.</p>
<h2 id="online-coding-round-at-codechef--3-hours">Online Coding Round at CodeChef – 3 hours</h2>
<ul>
<li>1st and 2nd question were of beginner level (<a href="https://www.codechef.com/problems/school/">Reference</a>)</li>
<li>3rd question (Easy) – You are given an array <code>A1,A2,...,An</code> of size N. A pair <code>(i,j)</code> is good if and only if <code>1≤i&lt;j≤N</code> and <code>Ai+Aj</code> is a prime number. You need to find the number of good pairs in this array. (Trick: Using Sieve of Eratosthenes
for finding primes)</li>
<li>4th question (Medium) - Modified knapsack question (Dynamic Programming)</li>
<li>5th question (Hard) – Based on DSU</li>
</ul>
<p>Out of these, I was able to solve 4 of them and I got into the next round.</p>
<h2 id="web-app-development-round--10-days-of-time">Web App Development Round – 10 days of time</h2>
<ul>
<li>I was given the tech stack which I had to use – PHP (Slim Framework) + MySQL + ReactJS.</li>
<li>I was given access to the official CodeChef API and the task was to build a contest arena with features like searching of contests, problems in it etc.</li>
<li>Interesting thing here was that CodeChef APIs are rate limited. So I had to cache the data at an intermediate server for a specified interval of time and then serve the results to the frontend.</li>
<li>I was asked to submit the code by pushing into a private GitHub repo.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="web-app-discussion--technical-round--1-hour">Web App Discussion + Technical Round – 1 hour</h2>
<ul>
<li>The interview started with how I built the web app and what were the
challenges faced.</li>
<li>Then I was asked some fundamental questions from OS, DBMS &amp;
Networks.</li>
<li>I was also asked to explain about the technologies I had mentioned in my
resume like Docker, MongoDB etc. (Pro Tip: Make sure you know to explain
each word in your <a href="https://rajkumaar.co.in/resume">resume</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-most-awaited-dsa-round--1-hour">The most-awaited DSA round – 1 hour</h2>
<ul>
<li>I was interviewed by someone who is an ICPC World Finalist for 2 times.</li>
<li>Given an array of n positive integers with duplicates, how will you convert the array such that all elements are distinct with minimum number of moves. The catch is, you’re allowed to do only <em>one</em> kind of operation but can be repeated any number of times; for any pair in the array <code>(Ai, Aj)</code> can be converted to <code>(Ai, Ai + Aj)</code></li>
<li>After some time of thinking and discussing with the interviewer, I was able to come up with a solution using hash-maps in quadratic time. Then, I was asked to optimise. After doing a dry run through few examples I observed something (replacing any element with the sum of itself and maximum element in the array), and came up with a solution in linear time. And then I was asked to code the same in my favourite language(C++).</li>
<li>My suggestion here is to <em>Think Aloud</em>. Your thinking process matters more than the solution itself.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-round-of-interview--30-mins">Final round of Interview – 30 mins</h2>
<ul>
<li>This was more of an informal discussion about me, my family background, interests. All I had to do was to stay confident and share my stories.</li>
<li>He also shared about the evolution of CodeChef and its culture.</li>
<li>I was immediately informed that I was in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here ends the one month long interview process and I’m selected for the Software Engineer Internship at CodeChef 🎉️</p>
<h2 id="preparation-strategies-and-tips">Preparation Strategies and Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>There’s no shortcut to mastery. Practice. DSA is very essential for any computer science engineer, which I realised very lately, since web frameworks may come and go but this subject has existed and will continue to do so as long as data exists. Hence, the high priority given to it by most product development companies.</li>
<li>If you’ve long enough time to prepare, you can improve your logical thinking skills by solving problems at <a href="https://codechef.com">CodeChef</a>, <a href="https://codeforces.com/">Codeforces</a> and also follow the next point.</li>
<li>But if the time is short, then it’s better to go for practising standard DSA questions on <a href="https://geeksforgeeks.org">GeeksForGeeks</a>, <a href="https://hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a>, <a href="https://leetcode.com/">Leetcode</a>.</li>
<li>Well even if you’re good at DSA, it isn’t sufficient to pass an interview of this kind unless you’ve some experience with web development. For that I would suggest you to learn some latest web/mobile app technologies and build some side projects. Also try contributing to open-source projects in <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> so you’ve a better understanding of how coding looks like in real life.</li>
<li>Prepare your LinkedIn profile and be an active user. You might find an opportunity anytime just like I did. It also helps you to improve your professional network.</li>
