I am Rajkumar, an ambitious computer science engineering junior, currently working as a Software Engineer Intern at [Directi](https://directi.com) contributing towards the [CodeChef](https://codechef.com) team, ever in awe of the wonders that 0s & 1s could create, passionate about FOSS & Product Development with proven experience in mobile & web app frameworks such as Android, NodeJS, PHP etc.

I have engineered an android app, [Amrita Repository](http://bit.ly/amritarepo), for my fellow college students to avail old question papers, timetables, exam schedules, attendance, grades and much more. The app has received 8000+ downloads in Play Store as on date, an appreciation letter from the Dean of Engineering, an average of ~4000 monthly active users and much love from all the students and faculty.
