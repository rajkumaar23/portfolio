I am Rajkumar, an ambitious computer science engineering senior, currently working as a 
Software Engineer Intern at [CodeChef](https://codechef.com), ever in awe of the wonders 
that 0s & 1s could create, passionate about Open Source & Product Development. 
I started my development with mainly Android apps made out of Java, 
then got to explore web technologies such as [Laravel](https://laravel.com), NodeJS, Angular etc.

The set of software I mostly use are :
- Jetbrains suite of IDEs for development.
- Sublime Text for quick text editing.
- Sublime Merge for complex git stuff.
- [Duckduckgo](https://duck.com) mostly, [Startpage](https://startpage.com) rarely.

## Linux &hearts; Open Source
Ever since I felt bad/disgusted about using non-activated Windows in my first year of college,
I switched to Linux &hearts; (Ubuntu initially) and never looked back. 
During my four years of college, I have hopped between multiple Linux distributions 
and out of everything, my favourite has been [elementaryOS](https://elementary.io) 
because it's simple, clean and less intrusive thus letting me be more productive.


## Apple üë®üèª‚Äçüíª
I am also a huge fan of Apple products, and their obsession in UI detailing 
&amp; providing a seamless user experience across their products. 
I have a strong dislike towards tablet-sized mobile phones (oxymoron?), because of which 
I currently own a **4-inch** iPhone SE (1<sup>st</sup> generation), and I use MacBook Air
(i5 10<sup>th</sup> gen) as my personal laptop.

## Security x Privacy üëª 
I have always had a fantasy for breaking stuff as much as I love developing software, 
and I look forward to learning more about it, especially on web security.
***
I also care/preach a lot about [privacy](https://privacytools.io) and 
how it's exploited these days.
