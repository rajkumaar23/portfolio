I am Rajkumar, a 19 year old, ambitious computer science engineering junior, 
ever in awe of the wonders that 0s & 1s could create, passionate about FOSS & Product Development with proven experience
in mobile & web app frameworks such as Android, NodeJS, PHP etc.

I have engineered an android app, [Amrita Repository](http://bit.ly/amritarepo), for my fellow college students to avail old question papers, 
timetables, exam schedules, attendance, grades and much more. As on date, the app has received 7200+ downloads in Play Store,
with an average of ~4000 monthly active users.
